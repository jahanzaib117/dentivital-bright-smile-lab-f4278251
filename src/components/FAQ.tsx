      question: "How long does it take to see results?",
      answer: "Most users notice a difference after just a few days, with significant results visible by day 7. For maximum whitening, complete the full 14-day treatment course."
    },
    {
      question: "Are Dentivital strips safe for sensitive teeth?",
      answer: "Yes! Our strips are formulated with our proprietary Gentle Techâ„¢ formula that provides powerful whitening while being gentle on enamel and minimizing sensitivity."
    },
    {
      question: "How often should I use the whitening strips?",
      answer: "For best results, use one set of strips daily for 30 minutes. After completing the 14-day treatment, you can maintain your white smile with weekly applications."
    },
    {
      question: "Can I drink coffee or wine while using Dentivital?",
      answer: "We recommend avoiding staining beverages like coffee, tea, red wine, and cola for at least one hour after each treatment. During your 14-day treatment, reducing consumption of these beverages will help maximize your results."
    },
    {
      question: "Are the results permanent?",
      answer: "Dentivital provides long-lasting results, but teeth naturally accumulate stains over time. To maintain your bright smile, we recommend using our maintenance strips once weekly after completing the initial treatment."
    },
    {
      question: "Is Dentivital suitable for dental work like crowns or veneers?",
      answer: "Dentivital works best on natural teeth. It will not whiten crowns, veneers, fillings, or other dental work. These restorations are designed to maintain their original color."
